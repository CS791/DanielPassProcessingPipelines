<b>Repository of scripts that I've made/appropriated and general tidbits. Obviously varies case by case, but core steps are described in:</b>

* [MNase-seq Standard Processing Pipeline (using danpos)](Documentation/MNase-seq_Processing_Pipeline.md)
* [MNase-seq Processing Pipeline using totalcoverage approach](Documentation/MNase-seq_totalcoverage_Processing_Pipeline.md)
* [RNA-seq Processing Pipeline](Documentation/RNA-seq_Processing_Pipeline.md)
* [Metagenomics Processing Pipeline](Documentation/Metagenomics_processing_pipeline.md)
* [SLURM compute cluster](Documentation/SLURM_job_submission.md)
* [Miscellaneous steps and tidbits](Documentation/Misc_steps.md)

Otherwise jump into the scripts folders of:

* Core scripts: Things that are completed and have posix or flag based input 
 * [BAM2SizePlot.py]https://github.com/ChromatinCardiff/ALD is the package for 3D plotting size differentiateing chromatin accessibility data.

* R-scripts: Often esoteric and environment-specific processing and charting mid-length scripts, ask if explanation needed.
* General Tidbits: Helpful oneliners and notes
* Unfinished: Scripts that are still in progress, or have been paused for a later date. Would not recommend.
